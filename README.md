# Fitness Tracker (Java, OOP)
This project was created as part of my coursework for **Java Programming** at Northwestern Connecticut Community College.

## Description
The Fitness Tracker program demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java.  
It includes:
- A `FitnessTracker` class with fields for activity name, duration (minutes), and date.
- A **default constructor** that initializes preset values.
- An **overloaded constructor** that accepts user input.
- Methods to retrieve and display each data field.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **LocalDate Class**
- **GitHub Codespaces** (development environment)

## Sample Output
Enter activity >> swimming
Enter minutes spent swimming >> 90
Enter month >> 2
Enter day >> 24
Enter year >> 2021

Activity log:
swimming 90 minutes on 2021-02-24
